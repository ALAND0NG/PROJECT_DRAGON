#Just loading in one obj as a test, all syntax for this file format can be found in this file
#First and foremost the hashtag is a comment
#This file is just to test the basic loader
#It will function by using the ECS system, and the file just provides all the information required to create entities
#We also assume that when loading a file, we provide both a entity number to start at, as well as a base position
#Meaning that numbers in these files function more like offsets from the information provided in the c++ game code
#Creates a new entity, E creates a new entity, and until another E is added the loader will assume all instructions are for that entity
#0 here is the entity number offset, CTRNS adds a transform component, and CMAT & CMESH do the same for material and mesh
E 0
CTRNS
CMAT
CMESH
#Here we add our transform data (In the order of position vec3, scale vec3, rotation vec4, first 3 are axis 4th is amount)
#We use the prefix S to set the values in a component
STRNS 0 10 0 10 10 10 1 1 1 0
#For the material, we will use the loadfromstring of the assetmanager, so we just need to give a string
SMAT StraightPathTexture
#Similar to the material, the mesh goes through assetmanager and will only need one string
SMESH StraightTrack
